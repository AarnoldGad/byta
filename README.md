# B.Y.T.A.

&nbsp;&nbsp; *"It's when you exchange something for something else, you say byta, it's like swedish or some shit."*

## The Story

Since I started my studies in Astrophysics, my teachers gave me crazy assignments with tons of values and quantities and I got crazy inputing those in WolframAlpha/Desmos, spending crazy hours figuring out the crazy conversion factors between crazy units only crazy astronomers use and understand. And don't you get me started on General Relativity and Geometrised Units.

I realised I had to do something and I thought: "That would be a great idea to add another project to my list of hundreds of projects I never find the time to work on", and here we are.

## The Project

B.Y.T.A. is a utility program which primary goal is to perform dimensional analysis and convert physical quantities from a certain unit system to another (Hence "byta").

It can parse mathematical expressions containing dimensional quantities, validate the dimensions of the result and convert this result to different systems of units.

## Examples

You're gonna have to wait for this

## Installation

I'll work on an explanation but just use cmake
